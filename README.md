# Description
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an embedded system for monitoring and optimizing the performance of solar panels. The goal is to create a device capable of collecting real-time data on solar radiation, energy output, and panel efficiency, displaying this data on an OLED screen, and enabling analysis to improve the overall performance of the solar system.

The system is built on the Arduino Uno platform and integrates several key components. A solar panel simulates energy production, a servo motor optimizes the panel's orientation towards the sun, an OLED display presents the measured data, and a current sensor monitors energy consumption or output. A joystick is included for manual control, and all components are connected using a breadboard, allowing for easy prototyping and modifications.

The project’s key features include the ability to monitor data on solar radiation, energy output, and efficiency, automatically optimize the panel's orientation using the servo motor, display current values on the OLED screen, and ensure simple construction through the use of a breadboard.
