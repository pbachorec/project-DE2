# Description
In this semestral project, we focused on the topic of Solar panel monitoring and optimization. The goal of our project was to invent and program a code so that the light that shines on the solar panel charges the battery and the solar panel follows the sun with the help of a servo motor, the control is done using a joystick. The servo was controlled via a joystick.
